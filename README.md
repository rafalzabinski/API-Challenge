# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

## Data:

* Python library - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy
* OpenWeatherMap API - https://openweathermap.org/api

## Tools:

* Python
* Google Places API

## Outcome:

### Series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


### Linear regression on each relationship, separating them into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere:

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Heat map that displays the humidity for every city

### Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
